Download the photo of the day from National Geographic and set it as the wallpaper

The script is intended for Awesome WM (http://awesome.naquadah.org/) i.e. it
uses awsetbg to set the wallpaper. I don't know of any standard Linux way to
set wallpaper for different window managers and desktop environments. If you
know of such way, please let me know.
